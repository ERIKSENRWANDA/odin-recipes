                                        <ol>

                                            For filling, stir together spinach, feta, mozzarella, Parmesan, and garlic in a bowl. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>

<li>Arrange 1 sheet of phyllo on a clean work surface and brush lightly with some of the melted butter. Top with 2 more phyllo sheets and more butter. Cover remaining phyllo with a damp towel while you work. Cut phyllo stack lengthwise into 3 (3-inch-wide) strips.</li>

    <li>Spoon about 1 tablespoon filling at the bottom of each strip. Take the bottom right corner and fold the dough over the filling to make a triangle. Fold the bottom left corner up to make another triangle. Continue folding until all the dough is folded. Arrange spanakopita, seam side down, on the prepared baking sheet. Lightly brush with butter. Repeat with remaining phyllo, filling, and butter.</li>

        <li>Preheat air fryer to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C)</li>

            <li>Arrange spanakopita in an even layer in the air fryer basket, working in batches as needed.</li>

                <li>Cook, turning once halfway through, until spanakopita is golden brown, 12 to 15 minutes. Cool slightly. Serve with tzatziki sauce and dill.</li>

                    <li>Cook's Notes:</li>
                        <li>The air fryer version is adapted from this Spanakopita recipe.</li>

                            <li>Make ahead: Prepare as directed through Step 3. Freeze on baking sheet until firm, about 1 hour. Transfer to a freezer container or zip-top freezer bag. Freeze up to 3 months. Cook as directed in Step 6.</li>
